    <string name="help"><big><b> How this application works </b></big> \n \t
    \n \t The \"data input\" button leads to the central part of the program. After clicking on it, a list of parameters that can be entered, along with the appropriate units,
        is displayed.
        \n \t The program has been designed to analyze results based on four possible variants simultaneously; however, some parameters are not obligatory to enter -
        without them, the program will analyze data using less number of concepts.
        \n \t For the program to work, it is always necessary to enter pH, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, PaCO<sub>2</sub>, and AG.
        Without albumin, the program will not correct the anion gap, providing results for 2 out of 4 available methods. If the user does not enter SBE,
        the program will calculate it based on pH and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> although due to the multitude of formulas for SBE, the data may not be identical compared to those
        that the ABG analyzer would give.
        \n \t After clicking the \"calculate\" button, the program will open the window with analyses that could be carried out using the
        entered data. At the top of the application window there is an information about how many approaches have been used and indicates the conformity of the results.
        Below there are results of particular methods, or information that the user did not enter parameter necessary for a specific method.
        The application allows to obtain a preliminary diagnosis of acid-base imbalance. \n
